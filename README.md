bash-settings
=================

Custom settings for bash, zsh, and vim. Most of the `.bashrc` was set up by [Lee](https://github.com/lgauthie). 

zsh stuff
=========

To get the `.zshrc` working completely, you'll have to be on Linux, but anything not Mac-compatible is commented as such, and should be easy to comment-out.

You'll need to install `xsel` (`sudo aptitude install xsel`, or `apt-get` if you don't use `aptitude` yet). 

You will also need to install the zsh mods yourself. Search GitHub for them!
